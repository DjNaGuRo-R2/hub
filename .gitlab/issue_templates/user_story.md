* _Negotiable_ (US are not explicit contracts and should leave space for discussion);
* _Valuable_ (implementation delivers an increment of functionality, observable by and useful to users);
* _Estimable_ (developers should be able to estimate its size relative to other stories);
* _Small_ (implementation fits in one iteration ‚Äì if it needs many to complete, it is an EPIC);
* _Testable_ (user must be able to check the acceptance criteria)
