## Objective

[Gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/wiki/Scanning){:target="_blank"} is a tool made to detect hardcoded
secrets like passwords, api keys and tokens in git repository. As it written in go, it is much faster than most of the
[alternatives](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/wiki/Comparison-with-other-tools){:target="_blank"}.

## How to use it

1. Copy the job URL located in the `Install` part of the right panel and add it inside the `include` list of
   your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see the [quick setup](/use-the-hub/#quick-setup)). You can
   specify [a fixed version](/versioning/) instead of `latest`.
2. Well done, your job is ready to work ! ðŸ˜€
