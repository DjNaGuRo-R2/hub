## Objective

This job allows you to run the units tests on Angular project. The `ng test` command builds the application in watch mode, and launches the Karma test runner.

## How to use it

1. Ensure sure that your project has 
   [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json){:target="_blank"}
1. You should specify your project name in the `PROJECT_NAME` variable, you can find it in your `angular.json` file under the `projects` section. You don't have to go through this step if there is a `defaultProject` value in your `angular.json` because the `ng test` command will be executed on the  `defaultProject`.
1. Add this job URL inside the `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see the [quick setup](/use-the-hub/#quick-setup)). You can specify [a fixed version](#changelog) instead of `latest`.
    ```yaml
      - remote: 'https://jobs.r2devops.io/latest/ng_test.yml'
    ```
1. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs
   customization](/use-the-hub/#jobs-customization)
1. Well done, your job is ready to work ! ðŸ˜€
