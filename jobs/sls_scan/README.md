This job uses the [ShiftLeftSecurity sast scan](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/sast-scan){:target="_blank"} which is a combination of various vulnerability scanners for different languages to help detect those in your project. This job permit to fully integrate it in Gitlab (sls-scan was developped to be used as a pre-commit and in CI directly).

!!! info
    There are 27 different languages supported(ðŸ‘‰ [full list](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/sast-scan#bundled-tools){:target="_blank"})

## How to use it

1. The job can be run "out of the box". If you need to personalize its
