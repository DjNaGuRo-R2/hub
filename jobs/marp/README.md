## How to use it

    !!! warning
        if the directory specified doesn't exists or is empty, the job will fails.


2. Copy the job URL located in the `Install` part of the right panel and add it inside the `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see the [quick setup](/use-the-hub/#quick-setup)). You can specify [a fixed version](#changelog) instead of `latest`.
3. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs
   customization](/use-the-hub/#jobs-customization)

4. Well done, your job is ready to work ! ðŸ˜€

!!! warning
    It's also [exposed as](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#artifactsexpose_as){:target="_blank"}
    `marp build` in merge requests.
    Exposition of artifact currently works only if you keep `MARP_OUTPUT_PATH`

    As soon as the issue will be fixed, exposed artifacts will be available
    with any output location.
