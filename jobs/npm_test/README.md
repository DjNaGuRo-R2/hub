## Objective

This job will run a predefined `test` command that can be specified in the `package.json` configuration file


## How to use it

1. Make sure that your project has
   [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json){:target="_blank"}
   file which contains the required `test` command in the `scripts` object
1. Copy the job URL located in the `Install` part of the right panel and add it inside the `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see the [quick setup](/use-the-hub/#quick-setup)). You can specify [a fixed version](#changelog) instead of `latest`.
