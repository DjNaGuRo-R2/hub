## Objective

[Nmap](https://nmap.org) is a tool designed to discover networks, map them, and
information that they could offer by being reachable on the internet. Its
powerful [scripting engine](https://nmap.org/book/nse.html) is very
flexible to retrieve this information.

This `nmap` job allows you to scan automatically your deployed server or the
