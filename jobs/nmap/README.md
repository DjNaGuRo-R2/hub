# ðŸ›¡ Nmap

## Description

[Nmap](https://nmap.org) is a tool designed to discover networks, map them, and
information that they could offer by being reachable on the internet. Its
powerful [scripting engine](https://nmap.org/book/nse.html) is very
flexible to retrieve this information.

This `nmap` job allows you to scan automatically your deployed server or the
new version you want to deploy. It is able to list every ports opened and check
if one of them should not be.

## How to use it

1. Add the corresponding URL to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see [Getting
   started](/use-the-hub)). Example:
   ```yaml
   include:
     - remote: 'https://jobs.r2devops.io/nmap.yml'
   ```
2. Choose a target

    !!! note
        This job can be run on external services or by running a container
        instance of your software. **You need to choose between two following
        options**.

    * Option 1: external service

    Add the IP address or the domain name of the service in `NMAP_TARGET`
    variable by adding following lines in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    nmap:
      variables:
        NMAP_TARGET: <address or domain name>
    ```

    *  Option 2: container instance

    To use this option, you must have access to a container image of your
    software. For example, if you are using our
    [docker_build](https://r2devops.io/jobs/build/docker_build/) job, just
    add the following configuration in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

    !!! info
        * The `name` option must contain your image name and tag
        * The `alias` option permits to the job to reach your application using a name. This name must be the same that the one specified inside [variable `NMAP_TARGET`](#variables)
        * You may also run some other services like a database depending on your application needs

    ```yaml
    nmap:
      services:
        - name: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
          alias: app
    ```
