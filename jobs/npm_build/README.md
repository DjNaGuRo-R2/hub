### Example to deploy on pages

Following example of `.gitlab-ci.yml` file describes how to enable Gitlab pages
deployment using this job:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - deploy

include:
  - remote: 'https://jobs.r2devops.io/npm_build.yml'
  - remote: 'https://jobs.r2devops.io/pages.yml'

npm_build:
  variables:
    PAGES_DEPLOY: "true"
```

### Artifact

When the job is successful, the build result is available as artifact.

!!! warning
    It's also [exposed
    as](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#artifactsexpose_as){:target="_blank"}
    `npm build` in merge requests.  Exposition of artifact currently works only
    if you keep `NPM_BUILD_OUTPUT_FOLDER` default value because of [this issue
    from
    Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/37129){:target="_blank"}.
    As soon as the issue will be fixed, exposed artifacts will be available
    with any output location.
