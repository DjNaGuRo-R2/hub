(or [Swagger](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/basic-structure/){:target="_blank"}) file to be generated.

The version of SwaggerUI used is compatible with OpenAPI Specification 3.0 and 2.0 (fka Swagger).
This job let you the possibility to change SwaggerUI version (see [versions](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui#compatibility){:target="_blank"}) to match with older specifications versions.

2. Copy/paste job URL in `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` (see the [quick setup](/use-the-hub/#quick-setup)). You can specify [a fixed version](#changelog) instead of `latest`.
3. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs
   customization](/use-the-hub/#jobs-customization)
4. Well done, your job is ready to work ! ðŸ˜€

## Artifacts

When the job is successful, the documentation build result is available as artifact.

!!! warning
    It's also [exposed
    as](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#artifactsexpose_as){:target="_blank"}
    `OpenAPI Build` in merge requests.  Exposition of artifact in merge request
    currently works only if you keep `SWAGGER_OUTPUT` default value because of
    [this issue from
    Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/37129){:target="_blank"}.
    As soon as the issue will be fixed, exposed artifacts will be available
    with any output location.
