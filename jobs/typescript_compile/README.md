## Objective

A job transpiling your typescript code into JavaScript using
[TypeScript compiler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript).

## How to use it

1. Copy the job URL located in the `Install` part of the right panel and add it inside the `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see the [quick setup](/use-the-hub/#quick-setup)). You can specify [a fixed version](#changelog) instead of `latest`.
2. Choose an option
   
    !!! tip "Plug and play available !"
      This job is **plug and play** ðŸš€, see the Option 1

      Other options need some configuration.

    ??? summary "Option 1: Choose the **plug and play** ðŸš€ mode"
      You don't have much to do, you can already **go to the next step**!<br/>
      In case you want the transpiler to work on a specific folder, consider 
      updating the variable `PROJECT_ROOT` with the target folder path.<br/><br/>
      This job is using the command `tsc --init` as a **default config** file.
   
    ??? summary "Option 2: Have your own configuration"
      If you already have `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` at the root of your 
      project, you **don't have anything to do**! ðŸš€ <br/>
      If the location of your configuration file is somewhere else in the project,
      update the variable `PROJECT_ROOT` with the directory containing the config file.

2. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs
   customization](/use-the-hub/#jobs-customization)
3. Well done, your job is ready to work ! ðŸ˜€

### Artifacts

Typescript compiler results are available as artifact.

!!! warning
    It's also 
    [exposed as](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#artifactsexpose_as){:target="_blank"} `Typescript compile` in merge requests.
    Exposition of artifact currently works only if you keep `TARGET_OUTPUT` as
    default value because of 
    [this issue from Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/37129){:target="_blank"}.
    As soon as the issue will be fixed, exposed artifacts will be available
    with any output location.
