## Objective

This job uses the AWS CLI (v1 for now) in order to sync files between a directory and a target S3 bucket. See changes between the two versions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cliv2-migration.html).

[AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/){:target="_blank"} is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

## How to use it
1. Add this job URL inside the `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see the [quick setup](/use-the-hub/#quick-setup)). You can specify [a fixed version](#changelog) instead of `latest`.
    ```yaml
      - remote: 'https://jobs.r2devops.io/latest/aws_s3_sync.yml'
    ```
2. Fill the variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` with yours. See the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).
    ??? summary "Need a custom Endpoint âš“ ?"
        Just type your custom url in the variable `AWS_ENDPOINT`
        For example, you can find the custom endpoint url for Scaleway on their [documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/storage/object/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/).

3. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs

4. Well done, your job is ready to work ! ðŸ˜€
