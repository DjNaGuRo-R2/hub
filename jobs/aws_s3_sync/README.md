## Objective

This job uses the latest AWS CLI version (v2 for now) in order to sync files between a directory and a target S3 bucket. It's compatible with all s3 object storage (not only AWS).

[AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/){:target="_blank"} is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

## How to use it
1. Add this job URL inside the `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see the [quick setup](/use-the-hub/#quick-setup)). You can specify [a fixed version](#changelog) instead of `latest`.
    ```yaml
      - remote: 'https://jobs.r2devops.io/latest/aws_s3_sync.yml'
    ```
1. Set your credentials variables in the Gitlab CI/CD variables section of your project (see the [S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html){:target="_blank"} about credentials) .

    ??? summary "Need a custom Endpoint âš“ ?"
      Just type your custom url in the variable `AWS_ENDPOINT`
      For example, you can find the custom endpoint url for Scaleway [here](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/storage/object/api-cli/object-storage-aws-cli/){:target="_blank"}.
