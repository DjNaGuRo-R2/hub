## Description

Run a security issue detection in your local dependencies using
[Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy){:target="_blank"}, a Simple and Comprehensive
Vulnerability Scanner for Containers and other Artifacts. More details on Trivy
vulnerability detection capabilities are available in its official
[README](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy#vulnerability-detection){:target="_blank"}

!!! warning
    With the default configuration, this job will fail if errors are detected.
    It's the recommended configuration to reduce security risks in your
    software. You can disable this behavior by setting the value `0` to the
    variable `TRIVY_EXIT_CODE`.

## How to use it

1. Ensure that your dependency manager is supported in [dependencies check
   section](#dependencies-check)
2. Choose a version in [version list](#changelog)
3. Add the corresponding URL to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see [Getting
   started](/use-the-hub/)). Example:

    ```yaml
    include:
      - remote: 'https://jobs.r2devops.io/trivy_dependency.yml'
    ```

4. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs
   customization](/use-the-hub/#jobs-customization)
5. Well done, your job is ready to work ! ðŸ˜€

## Job details

* Job name: `trivy_dependency`
* Docker image: [`aquasec/trivy`](https://hub.docker.com/r/aquasec/trivy/){:target="_blank"}
* Default stage: `static_tests`

### Dependencies check

Trivy runs dependencies analysis using the **lock files** of dependency
managers.

!!! info

    A lock file in development is an auto built file by your dependency
    manager which describes **exactly** all dependencies used with their
    precise version. It's complementary with your classical requirement file
    and permits to ensure that every environment get the exact same
    dependencies versions. Goal is to ensure that your application will always
    behave the same way, without any changes that may break a feature.

    It is
    [recommended](https://myers.io/2019/01/13/what-is-the-purpose-of-a-lock-file-for-package-managers/){:target="_blank"} to
    have these files in your version control system, to ensure everyone will
    get the same behavior from your dependencies.

    More details about lock files in [this
    post](https://myers.io/2019/01/13/what-is-the-purpose-of-a-lock-file-for-package-managers/){:target="_blank"}

List of supported lock files :

| Language | Lock file |
|:-|:-
| Ruby | `Gemfile.lock` |
| Python | `Pipfile.lock`, `poetry.lock` |
| PHP | `composer.lock` |
| NodeJS | `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock` |
| Rust | `Cargo.lock` |
