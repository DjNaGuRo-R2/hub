# ðŸ”Ž Zaproxy

## Description

Run a Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) in a docker image
using [Zaproxy](https://www.zaproxy.org/), the OWASP web app scanner.

## How to use it

!!! warning
    Zaproxy is mainly used to scan web applications and web frontend. You can use the tool to try and discover
    API vulnerabilities, but this job is focused on a quick scan for a frontend service (with or without authentication)

1. Add the corresponding URL to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see [Getting
   started](/use-the-hub)) and add a `services` section. Example:
    ```yaml
    include:
      - remote: 'https://jobs.r2devops.io/zaproxy.yml'
    ```

2. Choose a target

    !!! note
        This job can be run on external services or by running a container
        instance of your software. **You need to choose between two following
        options**.

    * Option 1: external service

    Add the IP address or the domain name of the service in `ZAP_TARGET`
    variable by adding following lines in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    zaproxy:
      variables:
        ZAP_TARGET: <address or domain name>
    ```

    *  Option 2: container instance

    To use this option, you must have access to a container image of your
    software. For example, if you are using our
    [docker_build](https://r2devops.io/jobs/build/docker_build/) job, just
    add the following configuration in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

    !!! info
        * The `name` option must contain your image name and tag
        * The `alias` option permits to the job to reach your application using a name. This name must be the same that the one specified inside [variable `ZAP_TARGET`](#variables)
        * You may also run some other services like a database depending on your application needs

    ```yaml
    zaproxy:
      services:
         - name: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
           alias: app
    ```

3. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs
   customization](/use-the-hub/#jobs-customization)
4. Well done, your job is ready to work ! ðŸ˜€
