## Objective

Using this job, you will have benefits of using 
[`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release){:target="_blank"}
with your own configuration. 

**Semantic release** automates your whole versioning & package delivery. Knowing from which version number is needed and 
generating GitLab releases to publishing your package. It removes the headache you can have determining which
version of the software is needed, and the content of your release note. Learn more on the 
[official documentation](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/){:target="_blank"}.

## How to use it

!!! info
    [Configuration file](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/configuration#configuration-file){:target="_blank"}
    can be written through different format, be sure to use a valid one (e.o. in `package.json` or `.releaserc`).

1. Have a valid `semantic-release` configuration in your repository, and update `SEMANTIC_CONFIG_DIR` with its path
1. *Optional*: If you are using [`@semantic-release/gitlab`](https://github.com/semantic-release/gitlab#environment-variables){:target="_blank"}, 
   add a [CI/CD variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#add-a-cicd-variable-to-a-project){:target="_blank"}
   named `GITLAB_TOKEN` containing a GitLab 
   [personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html){:target="_blank"}.
1. *Optional*: If you are using a plugin which is not listed in 
   [official plugins](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/extending/plugins-list.md#plugins-list){:target="_blank"}, 
   update `SEMANTIC_ADDITIONAL_PACKAGES` with the plugins you need.
1. Add this job URL inside the `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see the [quick setup](/use-the-hub/#quick-setup)). You can specify [a fixed version](#changelog) instead of `latest`.
    ```yaml
      - remote: 'https://jobs.r2devops.io/latest/semantic_release.yml'
