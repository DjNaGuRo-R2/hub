## Objective

This job will permits users to run several scripts from their `package.json` file using `npm`. Scripts can be used with args.


## How to use it

   [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json){:target="_blank"}
   file which contains predefined command in the `scripts` object
2. If you want the job to run scripts make sure to add them inside the `variable` `NPM_SCRIPTS` and separate every command with `;`
3. Add this job URL inside the `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see the [quick setup](/use-the-hub/#quick-setup)). You can specify [a fixed version](#changelog) instead of `latest`.
    ```yaml
      - remote: 'https://jobs.r2devops.io/latest/npm_scripts.yml'
    ```
