## Objective

This job allows users to run several scripts from their `package.json` file using `npm`. Scripts can be used with args.


## How to use it

1. Make sure that your project has 
   [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json){:target="_blank"}
   file which contains predefined command in the `scripts` object
1. If you want the job to run scripts make sure to add them inside the `variable` `NPM_SCRIPTS` and separate every command with `;`
1. The default stage is `others`, if you want to customize this stage depending of the scripts that you run, check the [stage
   customization](/use-the-hub/#use-custom-stage)
1. Copy the job URL located in the `Install` part of the right panel and add it inside the `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see the [quick setup](/use-the-hub/#quick-setup)). You can specify [a fixed version](#changelog) instead of `latest`.
1. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs
   customization](/use-the-hub/#jobs-customization)
1. You are done, the job is ready to use ! ðŸ˜‰
