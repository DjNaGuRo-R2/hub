## How to use it

1. Make sure to add a CI/CD file variable containing your [`kubeconfig`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/){:target="_blank"} file, more info [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#cicd-variable-types){:target="_blank"}
1. Add this job URL inside the `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see the [quick setup](/use-the-hub/#quick-setup)). You can specify [a fixed version](#changelog) instead of `latest`.
