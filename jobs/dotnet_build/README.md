# üåê .NET Build

## Description

Builds a .NET Core project with the different versions available, and makes it ready to run.
It is using the scripted installation provided from Microsoft, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-alpine#scripted-install).

## How to use it

1. Prepare your project in your repository with its `.csproj` file.
2. Add the corresponding URL to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see [Getting
   started](/use-the-hub)). Example:

    ```yaml
    include:
      - remote: 'https://jobs.r2devops.io/dotnet_build.yml'
    ```

3. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) üëâ check the [jobs
   customization](/use-the-hub/#jobs-customization)

4. Well done, your job is ready to work ! üòÄ

!!! warning
    Since **version 5.0** of .NET is still in **release-candidate** at this time, the format of `DOTNET_VERSION` is slightly different from just `3.1` or `2.1`. See [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script#options) (*argument `-Channel`*) to see how to specify this new version.

### Artifacts

When the job is successful, the build of your project is available in an artifact. The artifact is `exposed_as` (see [expose](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#artifactsexpose_as)) `dotNET Build` in your merge request.

!!! warning
    Exposition of artifact doesn't work currently because of [this issue from
    Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/37129). As soon as
    the issue will be fixed, exposed artifacts will be available in merge
    requests.
