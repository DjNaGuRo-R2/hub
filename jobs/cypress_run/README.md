## Objective

This job test your front end web application by running tests headlessly in a CI context.

To ensure that the job work you have to specify the URL of your server (Example: http://localhost:4200 for Angular web App). It's used to prevent Cypress runs before your web sever is up and available. You can see more [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Boot-your-server)

## How to use it

1. Ensure yourself that your project is set to use Cypress. You can refer to the [Cypress Getting Started](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress). If you want to connect your GitLab instance with the Cypress Dashboard to see there your job records - in case that you override the `CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY`, you can set up your project by following the [Cypress Dashboard documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/dashboard/gitlab-integration#Installing-the-GitLab-integration).

**Override CYPRESS_BASE_URL variable. It's MANDATORY** 
1. Add this job URL inside the `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see the [quick setup](/use-the-hub/#quick-setup)). You can specify [a fixed version](#changelog) instead of `latest`.
    ```yaml
      - remote: 'https://jobs.r2devops.io/latest/cypress_run.yml'
    ```
