Mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/){:target="_blank"} are ready to use.

## How to use it

1. Prepare your project with Mkdocs configuration file and sources files as
   described in [Mkdocs
   documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/#getting-started){:target="_blank"}. In your repository,
   documentation files must be organized as follows:

    ```
    /mkdocs.yml # This is your configuration file
    /docs/      # This folder contains all your documentation markdown files
    ```
2. Choose a version in [version list](#changelog)
3. Add the corresponding URL to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see [Getting
   started](/use-the-hub/)). Example:

    ```yaml
    include:
      - remote: 'https://jobs.r2devops.io/mkdocs.yml'
    ```

4. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs
