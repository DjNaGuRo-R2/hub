## Objective

Publish HTML documentation located in `public` folder, retrieved as an artifact
from previous job named `documentation`.

## How to use it

!!! note "Requirements"

    You have to use a job which build your documentation in a previous stage.
    We recommend you to use a documentation job available on the hub in [build
    ðŸ“¦ stage](/jobs/#build). They build documentation and publish it as
    artifact in `website_build/` folder.

    **Documentation jobs list:**

    * [ApiDoc](/jobs/build/apidoc/)
    * [Mkdocs](/jobs/build/mkdocs/)
    * [Doxygen](/jobs/build/doxygen/)
    * [PHPDocumentor](/jobs/build/phpdocumentor/)
    * [OpenAPI](/jobs/build/openapi/)

1. Choose a version in [version list](#versions)
3. Add the corresponding URL to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see [Getting
   started](/use-the-hub/)). Example:

    ```yaml
    include:
      - remote: 'https://jobs.r2devops.io/pages.yml'
    ```

4. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs
   customization](/use-the-hub/#jobs-customization)
5. Well done, your job is ready to work ! ðŸ˜€
