# ‚ò∏Ô∏è  Helm Review

## Description

Deploy your [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) charts as a review environment when a pipeline is run in a merge request

## How to use it

1. Prepare your project with the files needed for the [helm chart](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/getting_started/) in the `CHART_PATH` variable
2. Prepare the PGP variables (`PGP_PUBLIC` and `PGP_PRIVATE`) in your CI/CD variables in [gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/12.10/ee/ci/variables/#via-the-ui)
3. Add the corresponding URL to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see [Getting
   started](/getting-started)). Example:

    ```yaml
    include:
      - remote: 'https://jobs.go2scale.io/helm_review.yml'
    ```

4. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) üëâ check the [jobs
   customization](/getting-started/#jobs-customization)
5. Well done, your job is ready to work ! üòÄ

### Secrets

Secrets files are encrypted with the helm plugin [secrets](https://github.com/zendesk/helm-secrets).
It will allow to encrypt or decrypt any yaml files that you have in your `${VALUES_PATH}` so you can push values that will be decrypted at runtime but not seen from the source code.
For example, you can `helm secrets enc review.yaml` to encrypt it to a `secret.review.yaml`, so you will have some public variables in a `review.yalm` file and a password for example in `secrets.review.yaml`.
