## Objective

This job will apply all the changes set by `gitlab-terraform_plan` in the file `plan.cache` 

!!! info
    By default, this job will run using the default `local` backend, but if you want to use other [remote backends](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/index.html){:target="_blank"} instead, you need to configure it in advance, check [this](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/remote.html){:target="_blank"} for more information
## How to use it

1. Make sure that you have your terraform files in your repository
2. Make sure to add your necessary credentials
3. Make sure that you have created a `plan.cache` file set by `gitlab-terraform_plan`
4. Add this job URL inside the `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see the [quick setup](/use-the-hub/#quick-setup)). You can specify [a fixed version](#changelog) instead of `latest`.
    ```yaml
      - remote: 'https://jobs.r2devops.io/latest/gitlab-terraform_apply.yml'
    ```
5. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs
   customization](/use-the-hub/#jobs-customization)
6. Well done, your job is ready to work ! ðŸ˜€
