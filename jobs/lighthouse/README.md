[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse){:target="_blank"} is a tool developed by Google which analyzes web apps and web pages, collecting modern performance metrics and insights on developer best practices.

## How to use it

1. Add the corresponding URL to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see [Getting started](/use-the-hub)). Example:

    ```yaml
    include:

Lighthouse allows you to custom audits performed onto your service. See [Lighthouse configuration](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/configuration.md){:target="_blank"} for more details about it.

### HTML Report

By default, this job will export the data generated by *Lighthouse* in an HTML file as an [artifact](#artifacts).

This report will contain everything you need to know to improve your website's performances, see [gallery](#gallery).

### Artifacts

To see the artifact, you must go in the pipeline content and go to the tab `Jobs`. At the right of the job `Lighthouse` you will find a button to download the artifact.
