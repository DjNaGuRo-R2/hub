## Objective

Retrieve all versions of multiple jobs and create release for each entry inside their `CHANGELOG.md` files 

## How to use it

1. Copy/paste job URL in `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` (see the
   [quick setup](/use-the-hub/#quick-setup)). You can specify [a fixed
   version](#changelog) instead of `latest`.
1. The job can be run "out of the box". If you need to personalize its
   behavior, check the [variables section](#variables)
1. Well done, your job is ready to work and will be execute on your main branch ! üòÄ

## Behavior

By default, this job will be run on the `jobs` directory located at the root of your project and will create releases for each directory containing jobs files.

## Jobs files

Here's the structure of a job files :

```
jobs 
   |
   job_name 
          |
          CHANGELOG.md
          job_name.yml
          README.md
   |
   job_name 
          |
          CHANGELOG.md
          job_name.yml
          README.md
```


A `CHANGELOG.md` is require for creating git tags release.
The structure of the `CHANGELOG.md` is based on [keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) structure.
You could also checkout the [R2Devops documentation](https://docs.r2devops.io/job-structure/#job-changelogs) about it
