      1. Use a linked cluster with your Gitlab project, get more info [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/){:target="_blank"}
      1. Provide a kubeconfig file through the variable `KUBECONFIG`, check [THIS](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#cicd-variable-types){:target="_blank"} guide to see how
1. Add this job URL inside the `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see the [quick setup](/use-the-hub/#quick-setup)). You can specify [a fixed version](#changelog) instead of `latest`.
    ```yaml
      - remote: 'https://jobs.r2devops.io/latest/kubectl_deploy.yml'
