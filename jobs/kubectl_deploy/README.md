## Objective

This job will deploy your YAML files to a Kubernetes cluster, the cluster can be linked with Gitlab or provided using a `KUBECONFIG` variable

## How to use it

!!! important
    If you want to deploy multiple YAML files, you need to provide the name of the folder containing the files in the variable `FILES_LOCATION`.
    If also you have subfolders, you need to add `--recursive` in `$KUBECTL_OPTIONS`

1. Make sure that you have a Kubernetes cluster, you have two options:
      1. Use a linked cluster with your Gitlab project, get more info [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/){:target="_blank"}
      1. Provide a kubeconfig file through the variable `KUBECONFIG`, check [THIS](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#cicd-variable-types){:target="_blank"} guide to see how
1. Add this job URL inside the `include` list of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see the [quick setup](/use-the-hub/#quick-setup)). You can specify [a fixed version](#changelog) instead of `latest`.
    ```yaml
      - remote: 'https://jobs.r2devops.io/latest/kubectl_deploy.yml'
    ```
1. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs
   customization](/use-the-hub/#jobs-customization)
1. Well done, your job is ready to work ! ðŸ˜€
