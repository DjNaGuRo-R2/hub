Mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/){:target="_blank"}.

```shell
pipenv install
```

3. Launch Mkdocs

You can launch mkdocs in order to create a local web server with hot reload to
see your updates in live:

```shell
pipenv run mkdocs serve
```

### How to update hub tools

#### Guidelines

For `pyhton` tools:

* Pylint note >= 9
* Usage of logging
* Usage of argparse when args are required
* [`Format`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=format#format) must be used instead of `%s` or string concatenation with `+`
* Docstring format compliant with [Google styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#244-decision)

#### Requirements

Each tools have their own `Pipfile` in their folder to manage their
dependencies. You must install `pipenv` to work on them:

```shell
pip install pipenv
```
