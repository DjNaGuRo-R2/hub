# Concept

The **R2Devops hub** is a collaborative [Hub](/r2bulary/#hub) of CI & CD
**ready to use** jobs which helps you to easily build powerful Pipelines for your projects.

!!! info
    Currently, the hub is focused to provide only **Gitlab ðŸ¦Š** jobs. We plan
    to support more CI/CD platforms in the future.

Each Job of the hub can be used independently to create fully **customized pipelines.**
You can use them for any kind of software and deployment type. Each job can be
customized through configuration.
