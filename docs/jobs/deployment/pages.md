# ðŸ¦Š Pages

## Description

Publish HTML documentation located in `public` folder, retrieved as an artifact
from previous job named `documentation`.

## How to use it

!!! note "Requirements"

    You have to use a job which build your documentation in a previous stage.
    We recommend you to use a documentation job available on the HUB in [build
    ðŸ“¦ stage](/jobs/#build). They build documentation and publish it as
    artifact in `documentation_build/` folder.

    **Documentation jobs list:**

    * [ApiDoc](/jobs/build/apidoc/)
    * [Mkdocs](/jobs/build/mkdocs/)

1. Choose a version in [version list](#versions)
3. Add the corresponding URL to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see [Getting
   started](/getting-started)). Example:

    ```yaml
    include:
      - remote: 'https://jobs.go2scale.io/pages.yml'
    ```

4. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs
   customization](/getting-started/#jobs-customization)
5. Well done, your job is ready to work ! ðŸ˜€
