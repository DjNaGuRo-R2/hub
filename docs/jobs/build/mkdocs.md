# ðŸ“ƒ Mkdocs

## Description

Build HTML documentation form Markdown source using
[Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). All requirements to use [Material for
Mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) are ready to use.

## How to use it

1. Prepare your project with Mkdocs configuration file and sources files as
   described in [Mkdocs
   documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/#getting-started). In your repository,
   documentation files must be organized as follows:

    ```
    /mkdocs.yml # This is your configuration file
    /docs/      # This folder contains all your documentation markdown files
    ```
2. Choose a version in [version list](#versions)
3. Add the corresponding URL to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (see [Getting
   started](/getting-started)). Example:

    ```yaml
    include:
      - remote: 'https://jobs.go2scale.io/mkdocs.yml'
    ```

4. If you need to customize the job (stage, variables, ...) ðŸ‘‰ check the [jobs
   customization](/getting-started/#jobs-customization)

5. Well done, your job is ready to work ! ðŸ˜€
